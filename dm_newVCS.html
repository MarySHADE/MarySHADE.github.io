			<h4>How to use this site</h4>
			<p>This tool shows you the questions that will need to be answered to implement and maintain a sustainable Digital Health System. You probably won't be able to answer all the questions by yourself, so identify the people that have the knowledge and skills on the different areas covered by this tool and ask them the questions. They might be people in other departments or even some of the suppliers used by your organisation.</p>
			<p>Beside the questions you will sometimes see an icon. Clicking on them will provide extra information. Below is a brief explanation of what each icon means:</p>
<p><img class="icon" src="media/why.png" alt="Why should you ask this question" style="height:48px;"><b>Why should you ask this question?</b></p><br>

			<span class="popuptext" id="pop1"><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/is-collecting-data-through-new-technologies-actually-helping-us" target="_blank">Health related data is the fastest growing sector in the datasphere</a>.  Data storage and processing requires energy and server space, and a fundamental way to minimise the environmental impacts of your Digital Health System is to eliminate any unnecessary data. Answering the following questions will help you do this. If you haven’t read it earlier, this resource on <a href="https://digitaldecarb.org/data-carbon-ladder/" target="_blank">reducing your data usage</a> also offers simple advice.
</span></div> </div>

			<h4>2.1 What data do you plan on collecting, storing and/or processing over the next decade, on an annual basis? Are you aware of any other planned or existing Digital Service that is collecting part or all of this data?</h4></label>
	<div class="popup" onclick="pop2()"><img src="media/why.png" alt="Why should you ask this question" class="icon" style="height:35px;">
						<span class="popuptext" id="pop2">Planning mitigates the risk of wasting compute resources by either over or underestimating the data that you will need.  Overestimation will generate unnecessary data and underestimation increases the risk that the digital health system will not achieve its health outcomes.<p>If any of the data you plan to collect is already being collected, or will be collected via another planned digital health initiative, find out whether you could access it, rather than collecting it again from scratch.  Sharing data avoids unnecessary energy expenditure in storing duplicate data.  It also avoids the unnecessary effort, and likely data collection fatigue, in collecting the same data twice.  <p>Be aware that even when data is only collected once, data providers may find the exercise burdensome and data collectors may even resort to outsourcing the data collection.  Both of these can contribute to poor data quality. To incentivise people to provide and collect good quality data it is advisable to ensure that there are tangible benefits for each local community involved.</p> </span>

			<h4>2.2 How do you plan to ensure data sufficiency?</h4>
			</label>
	<div class="popup" onclick="pop3()"><img src="media/why.png" alt="Why should you ask this question" class="icon" style="height:35px;">
						<span class="popuptext" id="pop3">Data sufficiency means only collecting and processing data sufficient for the outcome you need to achieve. Data “beyond what is sufficient” can take many forms.  An example would be collecting data on employment or marital status when the digital health service being planned has no use for this. Other examples include:
							<ul><li>Images with an unnecessarily high resolution </li>
							<li>Monitoring data collected at an unnecessarily high frequency (what is actually needed to assess health outcomes?)</li>
							<li>High resolution videoconferencing solutions instead of phone calls or low resolution conferencing. </li></ul></span>

			<h4>2.3 What systems do you have in place to delete data that is no longer needed, and to check and manage duplicate data?</h4></label><div class="popup" onclick="pop5()"><img src="media/info.png" alt="Read more about this subject" class="icon" style="height:35px;">
						<span class="popuptext" id="pop5">Addressing the large amounts of data that are collected but never used (‘dark data’) can significantly reduce energy consumption.  Use the following techniques to achieve this:
							<ul><li><b>Data Governance:</b> Find the relevant regulation for how long data generated by the Digital Health service needs to be stored, and establish processes to ensure unnecessary data is deleted</li>
							<li><b>Data Management:</b> Organization of data into distinct categories makes it easy to find and gives an accurate and complete view. </li>
							<li><b>Data Sharing Strategy:</b> this can prevent data redundancy. </li>
							<li><b>Tiered Data Storage:</b> Store your data in a way that reflects how regularly it is used and the speed with which it needs to be accessible. Cold storage has a lower energy cost and can be used for archived data.</li></ul>

	 <div class="popup" onclick="pop6()"><img src="media/why.png" alt="Why should you ask this question" class="icon" style="height:35px;">
						 <span class="popuptext" id="pop6">Digital health systems may not last as long as originally anticipated, and the data associated with them is often simply left in situ. It is therefore important to have robust plans in place from the outset to ensure that redundant data is deleted when a digital health system becomes inactive.

						<span class="popuptext" id="pop4">Have you compared a cloud option with the local server option from an environmental sustainability perspective?  Cloud hosting is capable of achieving greater energy efficiency if it is correctly configured. However, be aware that other issues are being raised around cloud, particularly in relation to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/data-sovereignty" target="_blank">data sovereignty</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cloud/what-is-vendor-lock-in/" target="_blank">vendor lock ins</a> and <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/the-politics-of-data-centers/" target="_blank">social justice</a>. <p></p>Furthermore, while Cloud is usually more efficient for large scale processing, you will want to minimise the transfer of data between your Digital Health System end users and the cloud as this process requires energy and incurs carbon emissions.  This means it may make sense to undertake <a href="thesaurus.html#edg_com" target="_blank">"edge computing”</a> on your local servers if they are nearer your end users.


<p></p>If your Digital Health System will be hosted on a hybrid model – so making use of both local servers and cloud – investigate both of these options and consider how best to split the data and processing between them.</span>
