		<h2>Why is it important to consider environmental issues in Digital Health?</h2>
		<p>Digital technologies and infrastructure have environmental impacts associated with the energy needed to collect, store, process, and analyse data. While it is extremely difficult to quantify, estimates suggest that the digital sector accounts for between 2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse emissions (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340" target="_blank">Freitag 2021</a>). The digital sector also has environmental impacts associated with the mining of natural resources needed to build digital technologies and infrastructure; the use of other resources, such as water, to provide systems to cool digital servers during use, and the disposal of electronic/hardware waste. It is important that we mitigate these environmental impacts as much as possible, not only to protect the environment, but also as a commitment to health, since environmental impacts adversely affect health, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>There is evidence that digital health has the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of healthcare in certain scenarios, for example where virtual care is expected to simply “replace” in person care.  However, there are multiple caveats around this, and many scenarios in which digital health is not expected to be a “replacement”.  It is therefore important to consider the environmental impacts of any digital health service.</p>
<p>This is not to say that environmental concerns should always be the primary criterion when deciding whether to go with a Digital Health Service. In lower to middle income countries where health coverage may be limited, the fact that a virtual care service is not replacing an in person service should not mean it should not go ahead - it may be the only way of providing healthcare. Even if it is complementing an existing service, transport costs may relatively be much greater than in higher income countries, and this might put the existing in person service out of reach of many people.  Furthermore a virtual care service may be a more resilient method of providing care in a region particularly exposed to climate related challenges such as flooding or extreme heat, again more typically found in LMIcs.  Ultimately the balance of economic, human and environmental health, and social justice, will play out differently in every place and time and this tool is not recommending a one size fits all approach.</p>
<p>Finally we should acknowledge that digital technology can be very useful in adapting to climate change.  It can, for example, be used to create early warning systems for flooding or extreme heat.  Such systems can dramatically reduce the impact of such extreme events on health services. It can also make health initiatives much more resilient to the impacts of climate change, although this does require advance planning.  For example a virtual care service may be much easier to keep running in the event of flooding than a conventional health service where patients had to travel to clinics just to be assessed.</p>
