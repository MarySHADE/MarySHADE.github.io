		<h2>Digital Health tool development</h2>
		<p>The aim of this tool is to support decision making when considering the environmental impacts associated with Digital Health Systems. The tool is not designed to provide answers, but to indicate the questions that you will need to ask and answer to make informed decisions when trying to reduce environmental impacts.</p>
		<p>The tool adopted a 'system thinking' approach and is part of the PARIS-DE project, which aims to co-design a sustainable and responsible innovation framework for digital technology. The research considers the multiple, complex and often conflicting narratives that explain carbon emissions. The framework being developed will have responsible innovation at its core to ensure carbon emissions are investigated alongside wider environmental, societal and ethical issues.</p>
	  <p>Other tools that have been developed to help mitigate the environmental impacts of digital technologies include:</p>
		<ul><li>The EU <a href="https://www.greendigitalcoalition.eu/assets/uploads/2024/04/EGDC-Net-Carbon-Impact-Assessment-Methodology-for-ICT-Solutions.pdf" target="_blank">Net Carbon Impact Assessment Methodology for ICT Solutions</a>, which focuses specifically on carbon emission impacts.</li>
<li>GreenOps.  However, it is worth noting that there are <a href="https://medium.com/@jolindsaywalton/what-is-greenops-7eed58db87e1" target="_blank">concerns about the limitations of GreenOps</a>.</li>
	  </ul>
<p>There are also tools focussed on the economic sustainability of digital health initiatives, such as this <a href="https://mcsprogram.org/resource/digital-health-investment-review-tool/" target="_blank">Digital Health Investment Review Tool</a>. This tool was developed principally for public health audiences and it can help avoid common mistakes such as:</p>
<ul><li>The digital health initiative is not resilient in the face of connectivity problems</li>
<li>A lack of provision for ongoing maintenance, support and training costs</li>
<li>Interoperability problems</li>
<li>A lack of accounting for languages and literacy</li>
<li>A lack of alignment with the national digital health framework</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The avoidance of such mistakes is also relevant to environmental sustainability: If these mistakes occur, the digital health initiative is unlikely to succeed in delivering better health outcomes and resources will have been wasted in developing it.</p>
